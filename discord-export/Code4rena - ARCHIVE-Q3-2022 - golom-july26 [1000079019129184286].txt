@Saruman Hi there, is there a specific reason why there's a timelock for the `executeSetMinter`? As far as I get the minter will always be a `RewardDistributor` ? or am I missing something?


[07/27/2022 7:02 AM] supernovahs

[07/27/2022 7:06 AM] supernovahs
How does the seller approve the receiver?


[07/27/2022 7:09 AM] Saruman#3899
timelock so we cant simply change the minter whenever we want and mint more tokens to dump on unsuspecting people. And the function is needed because we might want to change the reward distributor logic sometime in the future through governance.

[07/27/2022 7:10 AM] Saruman#3899
receiver is just the guy who receives the nft similar to how uniswap does a swap and allow another address to be the receiver of tokens instead of msg.sender. this is useful to save on gas while using aggregators like gem/genie this will allow them to buy in 1 transfer call rather then two.

[07/27/2022 2:33 PM] benbaessler
is the supply set somewhere in the contracts? After reading through `GolemToken.sol` it seems like the minter could mint however many tokens they want.. @Saruman

Hi! for the gas optimisation pot, only the function in the gas report are in the scope or every function in the contract in scope?

every function from in-scope contracts. The gas report only shows public/external calls that are in tests

Does someone know how to get gas used for a particular transaction in the code. For example below:
```
await golomTrader.connect(taker).fillAsk(
                order,
                1,
                '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
                {
                    paymentAmt: prePaymentAmt,
                    paymentAddress: await governance.getAddress(),
                },
                receiver,
                {
                    value: utils.parseEther('10.25'),
                }
            );
```


[07/28/2022 7:17 AM] 0xpathfindr
My first guess would be to use the console and try and run the function


[07/28/2022 7:18 AM] 0xpathfindr
The console should return transaction info (including gas)

The library seems wrong, but I'm not very familiar with hardhat


[07/28/2022 9:22 AM] 0xa5df
You can log to console the `gasUsed` and it'll output in the test:
```
const tx = await golomTrader.connect(taker).fillAsk(
                order,
                1,
                '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
                {
                    paymentAmt: prePaymentAmt,
                    paymentAddress: await governance.getAddress(),
                },
                receiver,
                {
                    value: utils.parseEther('10.25'),
                }
            );
const receipt = await (await tx).wait();
console.log(`gas used: ${receipt.gasUsed}`);
```

You can also extract that single test to a different file and then run `npx hardhat test test/myscript.ts`, that will include other txs in the same test though

[07/28/2022 9:26 AM] elku.cryptos
thanks.. I also saw this in their js scripts. for example in `tradertest.js`:

```
    d = await trader.connect(addr2).fillAsk(order, 1, null_address, [postPay, '0x6067D233D5eA619d464a218eAf9921B9343e4d16'], {
        value: totoamt + postPay
    });
    receipt = await d.wait();
    console.log(receipt.cumulativeGasUsed, await funnel.balanceOf(addr1.address));
```


[07/28/2022 9:26 AM] 8olidity#8520
@0xA5DF  do you know how to solve this


[07/28/2022 9:31 AM] elku.cryptos
I am wondering why there are test files in `scripts` and then in `test`. What is the difference?


[07/28/2022 9:32 AM] 0xa5df
I think `gasUsed` is the right one, even though in this case (where there's only one tx per block) they're the same

Hi, can anyone explain the calculations behind `_checkpoint()` in VoteEscrowCore.sol?

[07/28/2022 5:00 PM] rustyrabbit
Is VoteEscrowCore.sol  forked from Curve ? 
`@author Curve Finance`
But aren't Curve contracts written in Vyper ?
So rewritten or from an older version maybe ?

[07/28/2022 11:30 PM] Limbooo#3710
Sometimes we need to remaps files imported in solidity for solc. Since they don’t appear in the same file url. For Slither; save a new config file in the root project directory as `slither.config.json`. Add these configurations
```
{
  "filter_paths": "node_modules",
  "solc_remaps": [
    "@openzeppelin/contracts/=node_modules/@openzeppelin/contracts/"
  ]
}
```

[07/29/2022 6:13 AM] Junnon#3182
wait, can we make a PoC without compiling?


[07/29/2022 6:15 AM] 100proof
Yes, there is no requirement that PoCs be executable. However, executable PoCs are the highest standard PoC that can be contributed. There's a cost/benefit calculation that needs to be done when considering whether to do one or not.

This might be a dumb question, but why is `RewardDistributor.sol` depositing the previous epoch's fees into the WETH contract in `addFee()`? What does this do? https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-07-golom/blob/7bbb55fca61e6bae29e57133c1e45806cbb17aa4/contracts/rewards/RewardDistributor.sol#L127

[07/29/2022 5:41 PM] Franfran#5067
That's only in the case of the first epoch


[07/29/2022 5:41 PM] Franfran#5067
It's valid to use the contract balance because only one epoch ended

@Saruman can I dm you?


[07/29/2022 6:29 PM] carlitox477
Is it necessary to do a the poc or just a description is fine?


[07/30/2022 1:36 AM] carlitox477
Does this means that if I found a bug but I don't do a test showing it and the bug is valid the submit will be accepted?


[07/30/2022 1:37 AM] __141345__
Can not find a function to place an order? How is the order book put on chain?


[07/30/2022 2:00 AM] 100proof
It doesn't work that way. The orders are created off-chain and signed. The user that fills the orders provides the order data structure. This is safe because the order is signed and any manipulation will break the validation of the signature.


[07/30/2022 2:10 AM] rokinot
just to add here, the order hashes are implicitly stored in the `filled` mapping


[07/30/2022 2:27 AM] carlitox477
Can some answer me please? It is my first contest and English isn't my native language, so I find it difficult to precise idea


[07/30/2022 2:32 AM] elku.cryptos
If the explanation is lacking, a high risk bug might get reduced its severity level to medium or even Q/A. so if you can write a testing code, do it and no one can argue with you. If not, explain it well at least. Just keep in mind that, the judge need to have an easy time reading through and understanding your explanation or thought flow.


[07/30/2022 3:35 AM] carlitox477
Thank you!


[07/30/2022 5:26 AM] carlitox477
When I add a submit, the **Links to affected code** should be only the code which is meant to be fixed or all the code involved. For instance, let said that function **A()** uses function **B()** and given that **C()** is somehow affected by **A**, should I link just **A** as affected code or **A**, **B** and **C**? (take into account that if I correct **A** I won't need to touch **B** and **C**)

[08/01/2022 10:10 AM] soosh4618
Thats likely due to golomToken totalSupply being zero and used as denominator in addFees(). I just added code to mint golomToken before the tests

idk if judges can comment this, but if possible, could they explain what happened behind the scenes for this contest?


[11/21/2022 9:28 PM] carlitox477
There were over 1000 issues reported, I guess it was that


[11/22/2022 1:17 AM] road220
just look at the number of dups 🙂

@carlitox477wow, my first time has yet been announced yet. How do you feel?


[11/22/2022 1:34 AM] carlitox477
Quiet surprised and happy, enough money to go camping in 2 or 3 weeks xD


[11/22/2022 1:38 AM] carlitox477
My 2° highest payout, and I can't believe it was in my first contest. I spent a lot of time in this one. I've improved my audit process a lot since July/August. Happy with my progress. Just in this contest + some which I participated just during August gave me around 1.600 USD. I learned a lot, 1 high and 3 mediums + many gas and Qa. I'm a bit anxious to get my first job as a smart contract auditor, I feel confident about myself
